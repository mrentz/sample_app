<TD>The term archetype is 'borrowed' from the 'Jungian' terminology of 'form devoid of content'.<p>

You see; Life is something over which you do infact possess absolutely no influence.<p>

'But I have will. My will is that it be!

Yes, exactly<p>

'BUT, SOMETIMES IT IS!!?<p>

And the other times are, well, simply, NOT as it should?.....<p>

To reiterate... If I may. Life unfolds before you, you are in possession of a 'concept' that is 'will'. 
And we feel we have complete and unadulterated authority over it because we identify with it as being our very own<p>

But it doesn't quite work that way. The law of 'cause and effect' you see.<p>

I'll explain. So... What was it that led you to possess that particular 'impulse' you call <i>your</i> will. 
What was it? Or to put it another way. What is it that makes you will your destiny in such as is your 
own peculiar individual manner?<p>

For example, you want to be happy. Happyness is thus what you will. It is your will to be happy. 
You are completely free to posses that will. Maybe not able to execute it. But free to will it nevertheless.
But what caused you to will this? Unhappyness? Therefore something else caused your will not you at all.
What caused your unhappyness? your circumstances?
What caused your circumstances? Something you did and/or said? Which must have been a response
originating from your own will ultimately.</p>
So your will is responsible for and ultimately the reason you currently will happyness. I.e. your unhappyness.</p>
Interesting you will for what it is that your will is ulimately responsible for you not having. And that will too 
was an automatic response to a prior motivation, or your will was just the effect of some prior cause.</p>

Your will is no less of an illusion in influencing the course of your destiny than it is in influencing 
the outcome of a script being played on stage as the production performs it in front of an audience.<p>

Your 'eyes' give 'life' to the 'forms' who's exsistence would be otherwise relegated to that coldest 
audience of all. That we know of only as 'oblivion'<p>

Fear, anxiety, betrayel, lust, avarice, bounteous and unbridled joy, supreme satisfaction. 
You name it, 'obsession', 'deliverance', 'acrimonious pleasure', 'malevolent civility', 
'reborn into a new existence. 'heaven and hell', reincarnation. 
That song you heard that brought flooding back all those memories and sensations from 
the era wherin it did originate..........<p>

All merely pre-exsistent forms for which your being provides the substance.
