Sometimes I prefer the term '<a>Understanding</a>' and will pretty much use them interchangeably throughout the discussion.<p>

You may be surprised to realize this but your knowledge is not necessarily such a wonderful and elegantly simple feature of the human constitution. As is your mind, and your consciousness. <p>

Knowledge arises from perception.<p>

We can not know what we can not perceive.<p>

Perception is conditional on perpective.<p>

Perspective determines perception, perception determines knowledge.<p>

Therefore your knowledge of an objects exsistence may be based upon your perception of it <b>but</b> your knowledge <i>about</i> an object is based upon your <i>perspective</i>. (i.e. perspective determines understanding/knowledge and judgement about any type of realisation in your mind that has been presented to it from what ever the source of what is being realised may be.)<p>

Your knowledge, understanding and judgements are determined not just by perception of the associated phenomena but by the way that they are perceived.<p>

The way we perceive something determines our knowledge about it.<p>

The point being........ We have virtually no influence over the conception we form of what is being presented to our mind because that is predetermined by our perception of it. That is, all we can ever know about anything is how it is being perceived. Remember, what can not be perceived can not be 'known'.<p>

Therefore a new knowledge can only arise through a new representation.<p>

Through changing/modifying your perspective you alter the presentation of the material being perceived. The knowledge and understanding upon which your judgements are based are only then provided with the mechanism by which those previously held judgements of yours may be altered.<p>

For example. The chair. You only knew what you did about it because you could feel it with your hands. It was only when you felt the photons bouncing off it with your optical processors did your knowlege about it change. The chair didn't change. Yet for you it was provided with a revolutionary new (albeit still only in varying shades of grey) existence.
