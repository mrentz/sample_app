<TD>The extra dimension is of course only our ability to resolve light within the visible band we we refer to as <i>colour</i>, but the word colour, would of course remain entirely meaningless to you as it is something of which you have never previously had any experience, whatsoever. Your esteemed friend has therefore deemed any reference to the term 'colour' as a word in itself as being completely superfluous and unnecessary.</TD>
