<TD><font style="font-size: x-medium; color: purple;"><p>You may be surprised to realize this but your mind is actually a wonderful and elegantly simple feature of the human constitution. It is also quite simple to understand<p>

The mind, in all it's elegant simplicity is however, very easily disturbed. Your mind is unbelievably <i>sensitive</i>. So, when considering matters metacognitive it is essential to minimise the influences that prevent you from understanding what you are reading right now. So that you can use it properly.<p>

To understand the mind you must first seperate it from all of its attachments.<p>

To find what the mind is we must separate it from what it is not. <br>
The mind is connected to many things and this may provide confusion. <br>
A bit like when you lose your phone. No problem, it has a built in locating defice. Problem, the locating device is in the phone. Defeats the purpose of having one really. So there you go. Thats why phones don't have built in locating devices.

Realization, mind. Seperate these. Go on. Helps if we agree on my definition of realization. 'To make real in the mind'. Your not convinced that you can seperate these two quantities, are you? It gets particularly interesting when you realize that your mind is currently what it is attemting to realize. And then separate out the realization.<p> 

Read on and I will endevour to explain what we must do.

<p>Imagine that you were born wearing very dark sunglasses. Very dark, real dark, so dark, infact that no information, not even that representing a single, weeny, little photon was ever relayed through the optical processing mechanisms of your cerebral cognitive system and eventually handed over to your mind. At some stage in your career you would end up walking into a chair. In the confusion you run your hands all over it. And so by virtue of your touch sensation running over every square millimeter of the object you would form, in your mind, an <i>image</I> of the object.<p>

This image is the realization you have formed of the phenomenon. Through touch you have formed an <i>image</i> of the chair in your mind. Ofcourse you have never seen a chair. And so your  mind has formed its image of the chair based purely on the information it has been provided by your sense of touch. 

Well your eyes are no different. Just a more sophisticated sense of touch really. Same with ears. Your physical senses are just part of your minds antenna array, which specialise in detecting <i>material</i> phenomena.<p>

<a NAME = "return">Now</a> we must separate your mind from your ego. Of course to do that you need to understand exactly what your ego is. Definition of ego - e/g\o Pronounced <i>ego</i> (from the english) 'That which identifies itself as being seperate from its surroundings'. (Don't worry about what the dictionaries tell you)

Ofcourse I could go on to describe your <a href="ego.htm">ego</a> to you. How it came about. The problems associated with it being an 'illusion'. All of the cunfusion surrounding where it fits into the scheme of things and so on. But, skip back to the inventory page and you will find it is not on the list. Which makes sense really. Seing as it is probably more to to with the source of your existing dillemmas than anything to do with their resolution.<p>

Then there's the small matter of your <a href="later.htm">consciousness</a>. Now this one <i>is</i> tricky. Separating your realizations from your mind is one thing. Don't worry, I don't expect you to have the faintest idea how to do that yet. But how are you supposed to separate your consciousness from the thing that is hosting the object of your realization, especially when it is attempting to realize itself?<p> 

<i>I'm glad you asked</i><p>

It's all got to do with the mind. We are going to have to break it down.<p>

Up until now we have just been breaking down '<i>you</I>' in order to separate yourself from your mind. So that you can realize what it is. <br>But in the process we have come to the stage where before we can go further, in separating your other 'parts' from the mind we find ourselves having to separate your mind from them. Which, of course, we can not do until we know what the mind is.<p>

The mind is actually a very wonderful, simple and elegant thing. Have I mentioned that? (I like the mind b.t.w.) It is quite simply the 'medium' whereby those things that are realizable to it are <i>imaged</i>. <p>

Never confuse what is being 'realized' from the 'realisation'. The object being presented to your mind, be it of a physical/material origin or otherwise, is 'what is being realised'. The image formed in your mind is the '<i>realization</i>'. Two <b><i>VERY</i></b> different phenomenological entities.

Remember the chair? Remember the mental <i>image</i> you formed when you bumped into it? Was the mental image the chair? Or was it not merely an image formed in your mind <i>of</i> the chair?<p>

Well now your glasses are not so dark. They suddenly become glasses that simply do not pass light with any colour. Just shades of grey like an old fashioned black and white TV. Your eyes meet with the chair and this new (black and white) information is passed on. Understand, what is produced is nothing but a more elaborate image, in your mind of the chair.<p>

The <i>chair</i> has'nt changed. Has it? But the realisation has <A NAME="aside1"><a href="aside1.htm">indeed</a></A>;<p>

A faint but still dim realisation of your mind should now be starting to emerge.<p>
To <A NAME="return to the mind">reiterate</A>;  the mind is quite simply a sort of platform 'on' which those things that are realizable to it are <i>imaged</i>. <p>

So you can see that your mind is not confused at all. And does not get confused. It doesn't actually 'do' anything (as such). It is merely the 'place' where images are formed. It is the images produced in it that get confused.

Realisation, and the mind are two different phenomena. Happy?<p>

I explained that we are going to need two things to get you up out of the dillema you are in at the moment. Well, that's not <i>quite</i> true. (well I did say three, actually), but we were assuming you were already in possession of the third, remember (internet connection). Fortunately I also presumed you were in possession of the other two as well. Well the third one I mistakenly took for granted.<p>

In the course of resolving the dillemas in your life you are going to have to follow some instructions. Instruction number 1. Don't take anything for granted.<p>

The third stock you will require in your inventory is <a href="consciousness.htm">consciousness</a>.<p>

Next we get into  <a href="understanding.htm">knowledge</a>. Which is even more interesting. This is because now we look into the 'form' that images produced in your mind take on.
