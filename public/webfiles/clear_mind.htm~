<TD>Well just say you're in a comfortable, quiet, room. You're sitting in a comfortable chair and your eyes are closed. So there you sit with what would seem like all of your material detection systems silenced. And in possession of a reasonably untangled mind.<p>

Your mind is still disturbed. Only now can I even begin to communicate just how sensitive your mind is. It is still being completely bombarded with images. From all sorts of receptors that are attached to your mind. Memory is only one source. Concerns, Thoughts, unwelcome sources of all sorts of disturbances abound.<p>

You see, your mind is like a kind of 'venue' that has been simply playing host to any impression that comes along. Which means it is merely the 'platform' for those phenomena which make the 'loudest' impression.

You 'weed' out the loudest, just to find that another one jumps staight in to its place, that is, it jumps straight into, your mind.<p> 

Before it can be of any real use, over and above that of a mere content container, as is the application for which it is currently performing. (I.e. reality as you have up-til-now-known-it.) You will need to know what to do with it. I.e. <i>'what it's actually for'</i><p>

Remember, the mind. I introduced as being <i>unbelievably</i> sensitive. And later that your physical senses are part of your minds antenna array. With particular reference to the detection of material phenomena. They are not the only ones. They merely form the group that detect external material phenomena. E.g. light, dark, hot, cold, hard, soft, near, far, edible, poisonous, etc. and hand the information over to your mind so that the corresponding image can be resolved.<p>

Then their are the internal physical system receptors. Of which hormones make up a major group. Invariably associated with 'mood' effectors. remember, your mind does not feel 'anxious' as such. It does, but not 'as such'. Your mind merely <i>detects</i> the phenomena and provides the platform upon which to realise the 'sensation' that is produced by, what is in this case, your material system.<p>

<a name ="digress">Yes</a>, your mind can actually be simplified into two wonderfully elegant and simple 'ideas' .<p>
&nbsp; 1. The detection apparatus. That is, sensitivity to the impressions made upon it (through the perspective medium which determines the '<a href= "form.htm">form</a>' of the sensation)<p>
&nbsp; 2. The image platform. i.e. the stage that develops an image of the impression/sensation. WOW! A bit like old fashioned <a href = "photo_lab.htm">photos</a>!<p>

Now it is <i>unbelievably</i> sensitive.<p>

Meaning that it is easily '<i>disturbed</I>. It is unlikely that you have ever experienced a still mind. You dont know how to make it still. You never realised that it was even possible.<p>

You need to clear your mind. To do this we must first allow it to become still. We can never actually achieve this. of course. But eventually you can see through the disturbances to a reasonably high level. The mind is of the nature '<i>Spiritual</I>' meaning that it possesses a fluid type subtlety. You cant just 'yank' out the material (forms) that it is hosting because this is only an analogy used to explain something which can't be explained because the explanation is only ever going to take a 'form' of the thing that it is intended to explain anyway. Clear? Good.  <p>

From here on in all phenomena that is detectable to your mind which thus results in the corresponding image being produced, in your mind will be refered to as your 'thoughts'. Your mind is but the host of the thoughts that are merely the images produced via unknown phenomena exsisting outside of your mind but for which your mind has some form of detection medium. For example in the case of the chair. The chair was the 'unknowable phenomena', the detection medium was 'touch' and later, black and white glasses. You can replace the example of the 'chair' with 'anything conceivable to the mind'. 'Fear' 'direction' 'opinion' 'comradery'. They do not exsist in your mind but only an image of them whos form is based entirely upon the manner in which it made its impression on your minds detection faculties. <b><i>PHEW</i></B>.<p>
 
We need to clear your mind of these 'uninvited' attention seeking forms. Think of it as 'tuning your 'antenna(e)''.<p>

The analogy with the camera breaks down when it becomes evident that we can not simply 'shut' the aperture, to your mind.<p>

Until we settle the disturbing influence on your mind that all of those indiscriminate 'thoughts' are having. we will not be in a position to achieve the necessary clarity your mind will need to posess in order to see what it is that you will be doing with the other items in your inventory.

That pretty well just about wraps it up for that simple little mind of yours for now. Because in order for it to experience the 'stillness' necessary we are going to need to use your <a href="consciousness.htm">consciousness</a>.<p>
