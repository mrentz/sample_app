Perception filters over an individuals human mind appear in layers. Well what has placed them there? They're exsistence is not constrained to the three dimensional space and time that your mind is still constrained by at this stage. Some of them exsist as a property of the human mind and some of these layers exsist as products of an individuals personal 'incorporation'<p>  

Look, it's a bit like this. You can only see the chair in black and white because of the perception filter that has been placed over your optical sensors unbeknown to you. You can't see the filter. You do not know that the filter even exists. You are never likely to suggest that there is more to the chairs exsistence than what you already percieve of it. Someone comes along and tells you that there is more to the chair than meets your eyes. Being very open minded to the suggestion you inquire further into what that may in fact be. They, in all their infinite wisdom, inform you that the chair does possess a very strange and wonderful property indeed.<p> 

'Wow'. 'What does it look like?' You exclaim in absolute amazement.<p>

'Oh', they say..... 'really, um.... er...., <a href="colour.htm" TITLE= "The extra dimension is of course only our ability to resolve light within the visible band we we refer to as colour, but the word colour, would of course remain entirely meaningless to you as it is something of which you have never previously had any experience, whatsoever.

 See my point?<p>

I'll go on to suggest that this person is also someone held in very high regard. And so you wander around telling everyone that he says 'all material things possess a very rich and wonderful property which we can not see'! And so they too are most interested as to what this thing could be. They are not aware that you possess the optical perception filter that you do. They hold the information that you now communicate to them in very high regard also.<p>
'Wow'. They remark. 'There is more to reality than that of which we are aware. And it is really wonderful!' They suggest total amazement at what it must be like!<p>

There upon they make their consultation with 'The man' and beseech of him to reveal more about this 'new' and 'wonderful' imerceptible dimension possessed of by all there is that does be. <p>

'Show it to us' they implore with their impassioned yearnings for that which is more about everything there is.<p>

'But I can not!' must necessarily by his most earnest repose indeed of needs become.<p>

'But we must know where we can come by such an is this new and wonderful faculty' <p>

'It was only that of mans ability to resolve the <i>colour</i> in all things to which it was I did refer when speaking with this one who can see the things in life only through the light in shades of black and white.<p>
