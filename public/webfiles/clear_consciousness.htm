Contrary to what is most likely your very firmly held assumption, the human mind is nowhere near as complicated to fully understand as it appears. In fact, not only do I know everything that you need to know about the human mind, I can also explain it very clearly, and nicely. Knowledge is a little more tricky, but still much, much simpler than might immediately present itself via your preconceived misconceptions about what would probably be involved. Just remember to remember that if it isn't perfectly clear and simple and understandable in every way than <i>you</I> are simply making it more complicated than it really is. Remember, at this stage that is all that you need to keep in your (otherwise very uncomplicated) mind. Okay. <p>
Good. <p>
