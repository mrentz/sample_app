<TD>The term archetype is 'borrowed' from the 'Jungian' terminology of 'form devoid of content'.<p>

You see; Life is something over which you do infact possess absolutely no influence.<p>

'But I have will. My will is that it be!!!! And THUS IT' <font SIZE="1"> &nbsp ..... ahem, clear the throat....</font><p>

 'SHOULD!!!!!!!!!'<p>

Yes, exactly<p>

'BUT, SOMETIMES IT IS!!?!??!!!'<p>

And the other times are, well, simply, NOT as it should?.....<p>

To reiterate... If I may. Life unfolds before you, yes, you are in possession of a 'word' that is 'will'. And we all think that we have complete and unadulterated authority over that which we identify with as being our very own?<p>

Sorry sunshine, doesn't quite work that way. Small problem of 'cause and effect' you see.<p>

I'll explain. So... What was it that led you to possess that particular 'impulse' you call <i>your</i> will. What was it? Or to put it another way. What was it that makes you will your destiny in such as is your own peculiar individual manner?<p>

Huh? <p>

Didn't quite catch that there sunshune.<p>

What...? Something over which your will has absolute determination?<p>

Well what determined that then?<p>

And so on, and so on, and so on.<p>

Your will is no less of an illusion in influencing the course of your destiny than it is in influencing the outcome of a script being played on stage as the production performs it in front of an audience.<p>

Your 'eyes' give 'life' to the 'forms' who's exsistence would be otherwise relegated to that coldest audience of all. That we know of only as 'oblivion'<p>

Fear, anxiety, betrayel, lust, avarice, bounteous and unbridled joy, supreme satisfaction. You name it, 'obsession', 'deliverance', 'acrimonious pleasure', 'malevolent civility', 'reborn into a new existence. 'heaven and hell', reincarnation, the Oedipus complex. That song you heard that brought flooding back all those memories and sensations from the era wherin it did originate..........<p>

All merely pre-exsistent forms for which your being provides the substance.
