It is only when we have finaly learned to guage the impressions and understand that the feelings they generate are there purely to provide a perspective on the object being presented in order to provide the image with its <i>form</I>.<p>

Emotions - anger, frustration, desire, anxiety, the whole spectrum of emotions we experience are not actually experiences within themselves. They are mechanisms of perception by which the phenomena that are detectable by your mind are presented. The 'feelings' provide a perspective peculiar to that particular emotion from which the object is being viewed.<p>

Now all of these things can be considered as being merely detected by the mind.  'You hurt my 'feelings''. Does that mean my antennae have been damaged? And I am holding you responsible?<p>

'You hurt a particularly sensitive one of my feelings'. Does that mean that it was able to detect particularly subtle phenomena?<p>

I can not reiterate this point enough. You need to separate the 'detection' of your existence from the form that is presented in your mind.<p>
