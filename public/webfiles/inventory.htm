<TD WIDTH="70%"><p style="font-size: x-medium; color: purple;">Okay. Good. 
You have now taken the second step in rising above
the dillemmas of your basic existence. Yes, BASIC. 
Obviously, being above existing within your 
dillemmas is going to be better, which made your 
present one..... basic by comparison. That's just logical.<p>

Now.. <h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Inventory</I></h4><p>
These are the things that 
you will need.<p>

So what have we got? Fortunately I think that there are actually only two things that you will need. (well... strictly speaking three, if you count an internet connection)<p> 1. a mind <p>and <p>2. knowledge.<p> But, with knowledge, I don't mean something that you need to know. But rather the faculty of knowledge itself. I.e. the <i>ability to know</i> as a stand alone faculty within itself. Right? (I am assuming that you have these two basic components available at your disposal? ( <i>And</i> an internet connection....). <p>

Well then we're ready to <A HREF="but_first.htm">start!</A>
