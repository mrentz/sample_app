Well here we are. We have taken stock of your inventory. You now possess a clear picture of what your mind, consciousness and understanding are and what they do.<p>

We stand here now with our gaze turned toward the dawn of mans awakening into new and higher realms of being.<p>

You start to form an image now of how those motivated by, what would appear to be, greed or envy, or preoccupied with the pursuit of status and wealth, or the desire to possess that which seems so tantalisingly elusive, are merely unable to see through the aberration of the perspective by which their understanding has become insinuated.<p>

You understand now that life exists through these views not in them.<p>

Their actions cause so much disturbance. Yet it is not so much that they are 'greedy' but that they themselves are merely the victims of such manifold influences that they are unable to see through themselves?<p>

You may be here, but you're not there yet.<p>

It is essential that your view of life has also been influenced by these emotions. Or you would remain unable to appreciate the force of their influence on others.<p>

The images formed in your mind are detected through manifold media.<p>

Cellophane over your eyes does not colour your view, it removes your ability to resolve that colour in what you see. Nothing can appear blue when blue covers the complete colour of your view. You can not see the cellophane and you can not see that which is under its 'disguise'. Remove the cellophane from your view and only then can you resolve this colour in the objects being presented.<p>

Of course 'cellophane' is only an 'optical' perception filter analogy. It is an analogy for the perception filters your mind has between it and 'reality in its entirety'. Removal of the 'actual' filters through which your mind receives its impressions, which currently constitute your complete awareness, is not a trivial exercise. Recall the term '<a href = "clear_mind.htm#aperture">aperture of your mind</a>'. (This is potentially of a very unique, peculiar quality that gives virtual definition to your reality.) It is also the medium by which reality is prevented from saturating your mental sensibility.<p>

I could remove these perception filters for you. But this would of course quite literally, 'Blow your mind'.<p>

You're just dying to know what it would be like aren't you?<p>

Well..... Hmmmmmm........ Let-me-think.<p>
