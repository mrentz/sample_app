<TD WIDTH="80%">Read their descriptions again, and again. It was probably a little heavy going at first. and it may take a little time for the concepts to sink in. But think of them as the 'bricks' and 'mortar' and say for <i>'knowledgability'</i> the 'architects plan' of the new, evolving, higher level of exsistence you are building yourself onto with. A bit like a building extension with the current structure being your exsisting undersanding of 'being'.<p>

Above all. Do not take any of this seriously. That means make sure that you understand it perfectly well before <a href="using_them.htm">proceeding</a>.<p>

Bear in mind, with any extension, certain structures will always present themselves as 'in the way' or in architect speak, '<A href = "redundant.htm">redundant</a>'<p>.
