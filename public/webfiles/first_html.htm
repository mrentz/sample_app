<font SIZE="4">Even though.... strictly speaking you probably won't (become famous because of any association with this site), you see, because if you did then you will be the sort of person who 
is more likely to have been visiting a website that caters for the 
spectacularly successful right about now. But before you go shooting off to find your fortune...... I've got some bad news. It's not going to happen. Leaving this website in search of your dream may really only be going to lead you down the path of illusion. Or, maybe reality, but what's the difference? Or don't you care? Anyway, I'm thrilled to be associated with the second best website ever created of all time so why can't you just at least be happy with your situation? Unless, ofcourse, you are, in which case you would be, successful. Which of course I'm not, but I'm happy. So does that make me successful? Well, I might not be as successful as you but then if I was it would probably make you feel less successful in comparison. Which might make you feel like you could be happier. But is happiness truly going to make you satisfied? The answer is maybe not, or, maybe. In the final analysis nothing will ever compare to the sensation of satisfaction like success will. So what is success anyway?<p> Well, you see, that all depends on whether or not your success is real or implied. Real, of course implying that you really <I>are</I> successful, as opposed to just thinking that you <I>look</I> really successful. Which, again, might just be all you are looking for any way. Yes? I mean, you don't <I>really</I> care how happy you are. Is it not, in fact more likely that you are simply just completely obsessed to within the reaches of your own instiable sanity, with how happy you <I>look?</I> </p><p> Well enough of this inane prattle. I've got the second best website in the universe to build.........</p></TD></div>
