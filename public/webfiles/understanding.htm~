<TD>I'm not going to try and tell you what knowlege is. <p>

This page is not about what knowledge is. As for example you might find on a page about knowledge in say, Wikipedia for example. I'm sure what it has to say there would be quite good.<p>

You are here to find out how your knowledge can be utilised in the pursuit of your elevated, existing dillemma free, existence.<p>

Mind, Consciousness, the Ego and the Soul all exsist as parts of 'you'.<p>

But next we move on to 'Knowledge'. I prefer the term '<a>Understanding</a>' and will pretty much use them interchangeably throughout the discussion.<p>

We are the product of 'evolution'. Not neccessarily every 'component' of us has evolved through <i>time</i> though. Time and space are just structures the mind uses to resolve material based phenomena into conscious images within. The evolution of consciousness, the mind, ego and Soul do not correspond to 'material' phenomena and so are not very easy things to 'image'.. Yes, that is correct. What ever it is that the mind is made of exists outside of the three dimensional space and time that it is bound to represent every concievable image by.<p>

Fortunately so is your faculty of 'understanding'.<p>

Which is the next thing you are going to learn how to use.<p> 

Stop.<p>

Think.<p>

When the mechanism trips, and your mind says.....<br> 'I understand'.<p>

What is it that actually happens?<p>

You may be surprised to realize this but your faculty of understanding is actually a wonderful and elegantly simple feature of the human constitution. It is also quite simple to understand.

To understand what understanding is you must first understand what the understanding does.<p>

When you bumped into the chair the image that was formed in your mind was 'synthesised' with images from other sources arising from memory. You thus performed a 'judgement'. 'This is a chair'. Absolute reflex. You did not think 'I'm going to form a judgement now'. It just happened. It just <i>happens</I>. <p>

There are elementary judgements. Physical bodies occupy space. Two bodies can not occupy the same space simultaeneously. One body can not occupy more than one space simultaeneously. All bodies are divisible. These exsist as part of the faculty by default and require no further synthesis.<p>

Your understanding uses these elementary judgements to synthesise basic mental forms into judgements. 'The chair is a body'. 'That is a window'. 'I hear a sound'

Then they are used to derive synthetic judgements of greater complexity. 'Few possess very much'. 'Many possess very little'. And then you synthesise these to derive further more complex judgements again e.g. 'This is not just'.<p>

When presented with something new the mechanism of your understanding immediately endeavours to synthesise it with something in the store of its 'experience archive'. Its function is to 'integrate' the image into your existing 'world view'. It does this by <i>categories</i>. And the result is a 'judgement'. For example 'Chairs are black and white'. As long as 'what ever the object may be' remains outside of your undersandings ability to integrate it your mind is 'open'. You do <i>not</i> understand. That means you can form no judgement about it.<p>
