<TD WIDTH="60%">This page is not about what consciousness is. As for example you might find on a page about consciousness in say, Wikipedia for example. I'm sure what it has to say there would be quite good.<p>
You are here to find out how your consciousness can be utilised in the pursuit of your elevated, exsisting dillemma free, existence. <p>

<p>You may be surprised to realize this but your consciousness is actually a wonderful and elegantly simple feature of the human constitution. It is also quite simple to understand.<p>

Consciousness can not be realised directly. There is no way to see it. Not even the most expensive, high tech, sophisticated piece of scientific instrumentation ever developed could possibly measure it. You could say that it is not possible to know what it is. we can't see it or measure it. <p>

It may seem a little repetitive. Like we are going around in circles.<p>

The reason counsciousness can not be realised in your mind is similar to the reason the chair is not actually manifest in your mind, but only represented by an image, limited by the way it is being presented. In our case touch, or black and white.<br> 
'Then put a limited image of consciousness in my mind so that I may at least realise something about it'. I hear you suggest. <p>
Consciousness is what is doing the <i>realising</I>. It is the realising faculty. Your physical senses are the antennae for material phenomenon, in this case, the chair. Your mind is the place that hosts the image, i.e. provides the neccessary framework, for the image to form, and it is your consciousness that 'sees' it, or, provides the mechanism of it's realisation. So in trying to realise consciousness you are currently attemting to realize the very thing that you are attempting to realise it with! If that makes sense. Which of course it does. It might just take a little effort. If it does make sense to you, could you then perhaps please <a href="mailto:mrentz@tpg.com.au?subject=It All Makes Sense&body=e.g. In trying to realise consciousness you are currently attemting to realize the very thing that you are attempting to realise it with.">explain it</a> to me?<p>

So let's now get <a href="mind.htm#return to the mind">back</a> to the mind.
